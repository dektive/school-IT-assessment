This project is a quiz application about Eddie Mabo, one of the individuals who fought for indigenous rights, and notably known for, among other things, overturning the myth of Terra Nullius. 
The quiz consists of some reading material at the beginning, which you can exit from and will NOT be able to access during the quiz. Most of the things in the quiz are stored dynamically via the .json file, which allows you to change questions, and, if I remember correctly (no guarantees), add more questions.
Hope its useful!
